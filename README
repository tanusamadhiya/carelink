## The Problem
Rural healthcare faces major challenges: most villages have only **1–2 small health centres (PHCs)** and very few doctors. When serious cases arise, referrals to larger hospitals are slow and manual, relying on phone calls and paperwork. There’s **no visibility of hospital capacity or ambulance status**, causing critical delays and preventable emergencies.

## Introduction
**CareLink** is a lightweight, multilingual web + mobile platform designed to build a **real-time rural health network**. It connects village health workers, PHCs, ambulances, and district hospitals on one platform, enabling:

- **Digital patient referrals**
- **Live ambulance tracking**
- **Remote doctor consultations (teleconsultation)**

This ensures faster coordination, reduces treatment delays, and saves lives.


## Key Features

### Smart Referral System

- Instantly alerts the nearest hospital.
- Reduces paperwork and improves response times.

### Ambulance Coordination
- Live GPS tracking of ambulances.
- Automatic ETA updates to receiving hospitals.
- Enables better planning and faster emergency response.

### Doctor-on-Call (Teleconsult)

- Reduces unnecessary patient transfers.
- Supports continuous care in remote areas.

### Health Data Dashboard
- Aggregated, anonymized case data for governments and NGOs.
- Helps monitor disease trends and allocate resources.
- Enables preventive interventions.

### Offline & Multilingual Mode
- Works in low-network zones using SMS sync and local caching.
- Supports multiple languages for accessibility in rural regions.
